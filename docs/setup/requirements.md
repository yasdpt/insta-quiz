# Requirements

To be able to run the application and develop it in your local environment you need tools below installed.

## Git and Github

For cloning and managing versioning of the application you need to have git installed on your system.

and you can follow these instructions for installing it: [https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/)

## PNPM

pnpm was used for managing node packages in the project.

## Database

Postgresql was used for the database of the project, you're free to use any database provider or setup your own server. I used the free tier of [Neon](https://neon.tech) as it is a good fit for the project usage.
