# Fly.io

If you don't have a server you can also deploy your apps on [Fly.io](https://fly.io) for free (it requires credit card).

You can use the Docker config already in the repo for deploying to Fly.io

Follow [this guide](https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/) on Fly.io docs to setup your server.
